# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated Privacy Policy page for Rankawat Web Solutions and make it accessible from the site footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new frontend route/page at `/privacy-policy` that displays the Privacy Policy content in English with a clear title, section headings, and “Last Updated: 05 Feb 2026”.
- Include the 8 policy sections (Information We Collect, How We Use Your Information, Data Security, Cookies Policy, Third-Party Services, User Rights, Changes to This Privacy Policy, Contact Us) and the provided contact details (Mobile: 76910 29526; Email: rankawatwebsolutions09@gmail.com).
- Add a “Privacy Policy” link in the footer “Quick Links” that navigates to `/privacy-policy` without a full page reload.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open `/privacy-policy` to read the full Privacy Policy for Rankawat Web Solutions, and can reach it directly via a new “Privacy Policy” link in the site footer.
